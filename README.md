# TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION
I'm excited to share that I've finished my first project as an intern at CodSoft! The goal of the project was to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a machine learning model called logistic regression.    I'm happy to report that I was able to complete the project with a 96.39% accuracy.
